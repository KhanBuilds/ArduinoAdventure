# ArduinoAdventure
Couple of programs that I wrote messing around with arduino in my spare time
# Motion detection project using Arduino Uno and HC-SR501 motion sensor

- Connected HC-SR501 PIR sensor to detect motion
- Wired red LED to turn ON when motion is detected
- Used digitalRead for sensor input and digitalWrite for LED output
- Basic breadboard setup with Arduino Uno R3

# Proximity alert project using Arduino Uno and the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor

- Used HC-SR04 to measure object distance in front of sensor
- Turned on red LED when object detected within 10cm (danger zone)
- Kept green LED on when object was beyond 10cm (safe zone)
- Implemented logic using digitalWrite based on measured distance
- Breadboard setup with Arduino Uno R3 and two LEDs (red, green)
